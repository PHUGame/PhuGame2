<h1><strong>Welcome,</strong> <br>To the Palm Harbor Games Website.</h1>
    <p>Most games were cracked by me, and others were cracked by sites such as https://steamunlocked.net.
    All games are <u><Strong>free</Strong></u> although I cannot personally say that all downloads are safe.
    A few examples such as Minecraft and FNAF are <u><Strong>not</Strong></u> the official game files and run the risk of being a Virus.
    Other examples such as Stick Fight, Lethal Company, HL2 Deathmatch, DOD, and more are my personal game files that I cracked.</p> <br>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>I love videogames and I want to learn to code. Creating a Videogame Piracy site is just a project to learn more about creating, developing, and working on a solo project. Learning new skills is hard and this is just an outlet to help me discover new skills and hobby's. I also did this to see how much I could personalize my school laptop.</p>
